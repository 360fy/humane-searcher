### Search for Type

This method build search results for a given type, based on input text.

###### **Method 1**

- TYPE  : `POST`

- URL   : `/search`

- BODY  : A `JSON` object comprising of following fields -

    - **type**: 
        * type of document you want to search [defaults to as defined in search configuration]
        * `null` or `*` means search all types and is called `multi` (response structure would change a bit for this case).
        * must be one of the valid type defined in search configuration
            
    - **mode**: 
        * search mode [defaults to `organic`]
        * modes do not carry any meaning to search, they are useful for categorising type of searches and thus search analytics.
        * valid search modes:
            * `organic` - user for manual input searches
            * `autocomplete:entity` - use for autocompleted entity based search
            * `autocomplete:popular_search` - use for autocompleted popular search query based search
            * `suggestion:entity` - use for suggested entity based search
            * `suggestion:popular_search` - use for suggested popular search based search
                
    - **text**: the input text [mandatory, can not be empty string]
            
    - **originalInput**: 
        * typically for autocomplete selection, searched text would different from original input text.
        * for example: person may have entered just `ss` and selected `ssc` from autocomplete box for search.
        * you can capture such original input here, useful for search analytics.
                      
    - **filter**: 
        * custom filters if any
        * valid filters are the one defined in search configuration
        * Filter structure: `{<filter-name>: <filter-value>}`
        * for `lang` filter only, `filter-value` must be a `JSON` object: 
            * `{primary: <primary-language-code>, secondary: [<secondary codes>]}`
                      
    - **sort**: 
        * a custom sort if any [defaults to `SCORE` based `DESC` sort]
        * Valid structure: `{field: <sort field>, order: <sort order>}`
        * sort field should be a valid sort field defined in search configuration
        * sort order should be one of `DESC` or `ASC` [defaults to `DESC`]
                      
    - **page**: 0 based page number, results are paginated in page size of `count` [defaults to `0`]
    
    - **count**: number of results or page size [defaults to `10`]
    
    - **requestTime**: optional requestTime that can be passed from client to calculate request RTT.
     
    Body may look like following -  
    
    ```
        {
            page: <page-num>, 
            count: <page-size>,
            type: <type>,
            mode: <search-mode>,
            filter: <filters>,
            sort: {field: <sort field>, order: <sort order>},
            requestTime: <request-time-in-epoch>,
            text: <search-text>,
            originalInput: <original input>
        }
    ```
